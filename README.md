Practicing different vector databases

# Vector Database Projects

This repository explores different vector databases and their applications in building intelligent retrieval systems. The focus is on text-based retrieval and integration with large language models (LLMs) using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **ChromaDB**.

## 📌 About the Project

Vector databases store data as embeddings (vectors), enabling fast and meaningful retrieval based on semantic similarity. In this repository, I've built:
- A chatbot using a vector database with RAG.
- A text retrieval system using **ChromaDB**.

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VectorDB_with_RAG.ipynb`    | Developed a chatbot using a VectorDB integrated with RAG.          |
| `chromaDB.ipynb`             | Implemented text retrieval where documents are stored in ChromaDB. |

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- ChromaDB
- LangChain / LlamaIndex (if used)
- Sentence Transformers / HuggingFace embeddings
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- Vector embeddings and semantic similarity
- Retrieval-based question answering
- Document indexing and storage in vector databases
- Querying using embedding similarity
- RAG pipelines to augment LLMs with external knowledge

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
